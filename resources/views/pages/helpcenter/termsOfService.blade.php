                        It is Uneleap’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to uneleap.com (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "uneleap.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.

                        <b>Website Visitors </b>
                        Like most website operators, Uneleap collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Uneleap’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Uneleap’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Uneleap may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Uneleap also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://uneleap.com blog posts. Uneleap only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below. 
                        </br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information </b>
                        Certain visitors to Uneleap’s websites choose to interact with Uneleap in ways that require Uneleap to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Uneleap gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at http://uneleap.com to provide a username and email address. 
                        </br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Security </b>
                        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<b>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information </b>
Uneleap discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Uneleap’s behalf or to provide services available at Uneleap’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

Uneleap will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Uneleap discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Uneleap believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Uneleap, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of http://uneleap.com and have supplied your email address, Uneleap may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Uneleap and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Uneleap takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
